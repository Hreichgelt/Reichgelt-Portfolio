## DESCRIPTION

This is my React web-development portfolio. It includes: a recent photo of me, working links to sections of the page, a way to contact me, a brief about me section, and my own photos that are linked to projects I've done so far.

## USAGE

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
